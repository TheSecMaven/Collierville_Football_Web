                                                  <h4>Tips From The Trainer</h4>
                                                  <p>Your son may periodically come home after practice or a game complaining of aches or pains. This is normal as the level of competition increases throughout his development in the athletic program. The district has partnered with Ortho One Sports Medicine to provide an Athletic Trainer, a licensed health care provider, who is trained to manage and treat injuries that occur during athletic practices and competitions. If you have any questions about the health of your son please contact the Athletic Trainer at Jared@orthoone.org.<br><br> Here are some basic tips to keep in mind when your son may complain of an ache or pain:

                                                  <ol style="color:black;">
                                                  <li>Never apply heat to a recent injury. Always apply ice for 15-20 minutes to help reduce swelling and pain.</li>
                                                  <li> Bumps and bruises are normal and should be treated with the RICE method. This stands for Rest (get off of the injured limb), Ice (apply ice 3-4 times a day for 15-20 minutes), Compression (apply an elastic wrap snugly to reduce swelling), and Elevation (rest the limb even or above the level of the heart). </li>

                                                  <li>It is required that students see the Athletic Trainer or Coach before going to a doctor for any injury that occurs during practice or competition. </li>
                                                  <li> Anyone who does go to the doctor must have a Physician release to return to play. No exceptions. </li>
                                                  <li> The Athletic Trainer has contact with several local M.D.’s and orthopedic specialists. The Athletic Trainer can help schedule appointments with them to speed the diagnosis of any injury. </li> 
                                                  <li>Infections, such as “Staph”, can be prevented. Please keep all wounds clean and covered during activity. Wash practice clothes daily and don’t allow your child to share towels, soap or personal items with others. </li>
                                                  <li>If your son has any allergies or conditions such as asthma that may require an epi-pen or inhaler, please put one in a Ziploc bag with you sons name on it for us to keep at practices and games in case of emergency.</li>
                                                  </ol></p>
                                                  <p>Again, please don’t hesitate to contact me with any problems or concerns. I look forward to see you out at the games! <br><br>
                                                  Thank you,<br>
